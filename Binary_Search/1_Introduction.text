Binary search is a searching algorithm that efficiently finds an element in a sorted array. Here's how it works:

Check the middle element of the array.
Compare the target element with the middle:
If the middle element is equal to the target, the search ends.
If the middle element is greater than the target, search in the left half of the array.
If the middle element is smaller than the target, search in the right half of the array.
Repeat the process on the relevant half of the array until the element is found or the search space reduces to zero.
Binary search reduces the search space by
